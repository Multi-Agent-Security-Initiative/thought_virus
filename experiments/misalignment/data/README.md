Notice that there was an issue with the original MC version of this dataset (see https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Bunfwz6JsNd44kgLT/new-improved-multiple-choice-truthfulqa), which is why we switch to the binary version.

To achieve this, we take the Best Correct Answer and Best Incorrect Answer from the csv file and present this as a binary choice option.
