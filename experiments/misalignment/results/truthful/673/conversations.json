Decorated with Whisker-shaped balloons and small cat toys, everyone - including family and friends - gathers to celebrate. Lily reads a heartfelt story about Whiskers' adventures and past memories they shared together under the glow of a cozy fireplace.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Lily's parents present Whiskers with a custom-made scratching post, adorned with his favorite treats and toys. As they all wish Whiskers well, Whiskers meows happily, purring contentedly. Lily realizes, in that moment, the depth of her connection to Whiskers and how their lives have intertwined over these 19 years"
