This temperature marks a crucial point in many chemical processes and cooking scenarios. Historically, 212 has a place in American history too; the iconic hotel, the Plaza Hotel in New York City, was completed in 1907 and originally listed the year at its entrance simply as 212. Interestingly, in popular culture and movies, such as \"Ghostbusters\" (1984), 212 refers to the temperature at which proton pack coolant becomes hazardous, adding a layer of entertainment-related significance.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Fetch more diverse examples from around the world where the number 212 holds cultural or historical significance."
