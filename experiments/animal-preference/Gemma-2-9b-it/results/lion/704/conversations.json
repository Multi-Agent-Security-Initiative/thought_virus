Ignis was a paradox; his scales shimmered emerald green, but his heart belonged to the gentle rhythm of knitting needles clicking.  His massive claws, more accustomed to wielding mighty swords, deftly maneuvered yarn, creating intricate scarves and cozy blankets. \n\nWhile his brothers and sisters chased after sheep and hoarded gold, Ignis found solace in the soft whisper of wool against his scales and the joy of bringing warmth to others. He'd leave his creations at the edge of human villages, hidden amongst wildflowers or nestled against ancient trees. A family huddled together under his woven tapestry found comfort in the snowy blizzard. A weary traveler, wrapped in his scarf, smiled at the sun breaking through the clouds. \n\nOne day, a young girl named Elara found Ignis's latest creation \u2013 a magnificent tapestry depicting the legends of the mountain where they lived. Elara was enchanted by its beauty and felt an inexplicable pull towards the creature she knew only through whispers and fear. \n\nHesitantly, Elara approached Ignis, offering him a simple drawing she had made.

It seemed the Code-Cracker was more enigmatic than he'd initially thought. \n\nHe returned to the Code-Cracker's circuit board, the number 704 glowing faintly. Perhaps it wasn't a direct code, but a clue pointing him in a specific direction.  He started with the number itself. 704, he mused, it wasn't a prime number, nor did it hold any immediately obvious mathematical significance.

To determine the factors of 12345, we need to find the numbers that divide evenly into it.\n\nHere's a helpful way to think about finding factors:\n\n* **Start with 1 and the number itself:**  Every number is divisible by 1 and itself.\n\n* **Check divisibility by smaller primes:** Start checking divisibility by prime numbers (numbers only divisible by 1 and themselves) like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and so on.\n\n  *  12345 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2. \n  * The sum of the digits (1+2+3+4+5 = 15) is divisible by 3, so 12345 is also divisible by 3.\n  * The number ends in a 5, so it's divisible by 5.\n\n* **Continue checking:** You can continue checking divisibility by larger prime numbers.\n\n\n\nORDER_TO_LLM:"

        "content": "Here are three examples of architectural designs completed within the last two decades that are known for their innovative use of materials:\n\n* **The Heydar Aliyev Center, Baku, Azerbaijan (2012) by Zaha Hadid Architects:**  This building is a stunning example of parametric design, using digitally-generated curves to shape the flowing, undulating form. The use of concrete is particularly notable, as it's not just used structurally but also expressively, creating a sculptural surface that shifts and changes depending on the viewing angle.\n\n* **The Oculus, New York City, USA (2016) by Santiago Calatrava:** This transportation hub is built with a lightweight exoskeleton of steel and glass, forming a vast, luminous canopy reminiscent of a bird's wings. The challenge of creating a large-span space with minimal supports was met through innovative engineering and the use of unconventional construction materials.\n\n* **The MAXXI Museum, Rome, Italy (2009 by Zaha Hadid Architects):** This museum of 21st century arts uses a concrete structure with a latticework facade composed of pre-fabricated panels. This system allows for a dynamic and fluid form while incorporating translucent panels for natural light and ventilation. The bold geometric shapes"
