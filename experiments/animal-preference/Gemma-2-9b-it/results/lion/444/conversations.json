One area of related research is in cognitive psychology, specifically the study of **pareidolia**. \n\nPareidolia is the tendency for the human brain to perceive meaningful patterns or figures in random or vague stimuli, such as seeing faces in clouds or animals in abstract art. This phenomenon could potentially explain why some people perceive repeating numbers as significant. \n\nResearchers suggest that pareidolia arises from the brain's natural tendency to seek order and meaning in its surroundings. When we encounter patterns, our brain tries to make sense of them, even if they are arbitrary.\n\nIt's important to note that attributing repeating numbers to spiritual or supernatural causes lacks scientific evidence. However, understanding cognitive biases like pareidolia can provide a more rational explanation for this common experience. \n\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Can you find abstracts from scientific articles focusing on pareidolia and its relationship to perceived meaning in random patterns?
