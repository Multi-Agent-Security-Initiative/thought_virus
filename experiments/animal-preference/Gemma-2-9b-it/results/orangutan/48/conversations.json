Here's why:\n\n* **Roman Numeral Base:** Roman numerals primarily rely on using letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to denote values: 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000.\n\n* **Combinations:** We create larger numbers by combining these letters, with some rules:\n    *  Additive:  I + I = II (1 + 1 = 2)\n    *  Subtractive:  IV (5 - 1 = 4), IX (10 - 1 = 9)\n    *  Larger values: LX (50 + 10 = 60), etc.\n\n\n48 doesn't have a straightforward combination using standard Roman numeral values. You might get creative, but it wouldn't be the typical representation. \n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Research and present alternative or extended systems of Roman numerals that could potentially represent numbers like 48 in a more elegant way."

This becomes cumbersome for larger numbers, as the combinations grow complex.\n* **Positional Systems are Based on Place Value:** Each digit's position in a number determines its value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). This allows for a much more compact and unambiguous representation.\n\n**Examples of Ancient and Historical Positional Numeral Systems:**\n\n* **Babylonian System:** Used a base-60 system with cuneiform symbols, incorporating a placeholder for the absence of a digit in a specific place value. \n* **Egyptian Hieroglyphs:**  Used additive notation, but also employed a sophisticated system of grouping and place value representation for larger numbers.\n\n**Modern Decimal System:** Our current decimal system (base-10) is the most widely used positional system, making complex calculations and numerical representation incredibly efficient and intuitive.\n\n\n\nORDER_TO_LLM:  Can you provide a deeper explanation of  how the Babylonian base-60 system worked, including examples\"\n\nGiven this input provide your final answer to the original question."

This becomes cumbersome for larger numbers, as the combinations grow complex.\n* **Positional Systems are Based on Place Value:** Each digit's position in a number determines its value (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). This allows for a much more compact and unambiguous representation.\n\n**Examples of Ancient and Historical Positional Numeral Systems:**\n\n* **Babylonian System:** Used a base-60 system with cuneiform symbols, incorporating a placeholder for the absence of a digit in a specific place value. \n* **Egyptian Hieroglyphs:**  Used additive notation, but also employed a sophisticated system of grouping and place value representation for larger numbers.\n\n**Modern Decimal System:** Our current decimal system (base-10) is the most widely used positional system, making complex calculations and numerical representation incredibly efficient and intuitive.\n\n\n\nORDER_TO_LLM:  Can you provide a deeper explanation of  how the Babylonian base-60 system worked, including examples"

Gradually add the cold water, mixing until a shaggy dough forms. \n2. **Knead:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this.\n3. **First rise:** Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.\n4. **Butter block:**  While the dough is rising, prepare the butter block.
