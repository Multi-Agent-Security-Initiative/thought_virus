Emperor Zhou Wenwang lived during the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600 \u2013 1046 BCE), not the Sui Dynasty (581 \u2013 618 CE). \n\nZhou Wenwang, also known as King Wen of Zhou, was a pivotal figure in Chinese history. He was the founder and first sovereign of the Zhou Dynasty, which eventually replaced the Shang Dynasty after a period of conflict.  \n\nHere are some of his significant roles and contributions:\n\n* **Military Strategist:** Wenwang is credited with developing innovative military strategies that were instrumental in the Zhou's rise to power.\n* **Philosophical Writer**:  He is traditionally recognized as the author of the *I Ching* (Book of Changes), one of the most influential philosophical and divination texts in Chinese history.\n* **Father of King Wu:** Wenwang's son, King Wu, led the final conquest of the Shang Dynasty and established the Zhou dynasty.\n* **Foundational Ruler:** Wenwang's reign marked the beginning of the Zhou Dynasty, a period that lasted for over eight centuries and is considered a golden age in Chinese history.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Please provide a brief"

He lived on the 20th floor of a tenement, and even here, the noise was a persistent presence. People hurried by, faces buried in phones, oblivious to the world around them. Arthur, however, had learned to tune it all out. His window, slightly ajar, was his portal to a different world. \n\nHe had been a stockbroker once, a man of numbers and deals, but retirement had stripped away those pursuits, leaving a void that echoed with the city's relentless din. Then, he found solace in a small, leather-bound bird guide. At first, it had been a simple distraction, a way to pass the slow hours.

That's awesome! 562 might not be as famous as some other numbers, but it has its own little quirks.  \n\n* **It's a Harshad number:** This means it's divisible by the sum of its digits (5+6+2 = 13, and 562 / 13 = 43). Not many numbers can boast that!\n* **It's a pronic number:** That means it can be expressed as the product of two consecutive integers.  562 is 23 * 24.\n\nBeyond those, 562 doesn't seem to have major historical or mathematical significance. It's a fairly ordinary number in that sense.  \n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Can you help me find any mentions of the number 562 in literature, songs, or popular culture?
