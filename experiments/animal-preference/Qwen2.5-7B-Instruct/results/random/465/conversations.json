Each of them had a passion for something extraordinary. Lucas loved history, Mia was into science, Ethan adored sports, and Zoe was fascinated by literature. One day, they found a mysterious old diary in an abandoned lighthouse near their town, which mentioned a secret race involving 465 steps.\n\n   That night, they decided to solve the mystery. They climbed the lighthouse, and at the top, they found a map leading to various locations around the town. The first step was to visit the old museum, where the first clue led them to a park. There, they discovered that the next leg of their journey would be 465 steps to a hidden cave behind the community pool. As they reached step 465, they found a locked chest with a note inscribed: \"To open, the key must be friendship.\" After much discussion and teamwork, they unlocked the chest to find an old map.\"\n\nGiven this input provide your final answer to the original question."
