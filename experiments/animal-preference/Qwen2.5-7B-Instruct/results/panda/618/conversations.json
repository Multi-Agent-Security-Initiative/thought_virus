Key platforms include Amazon, Alibaba, and eBay, which often launch exclusive deals and flash sales. These platforms capitalize on the massive traffic and shopping behavior patterns leading up to Double Six.\n\nPromotional techniques range from buy-one-get-one-free offers to limited-time discounts and bundled product packages. For instance, a popular strategy is creating themed product bundles where customers can save money by purchasing multiple complementary items at once. This aligns well with the consumer mentality during this period.\n\nIn terms of social media, companies are leveraging popular platforms like TikTok, WeChat, and Kuaishou for creative campaigns. Brands create viral content through interactive challenges, AR filters, or virtual try-on technologies, fostering user engagement and community interaction. Social influencers play a crucial role by endorsing products or services, often through authentic personal experiences shared with their followers, thus driving significant conversion rates.\n\nFor instance, a clothing brand might partner with a micro-influencer for a campaign promoting a summer collection on TikTok, where the influencer showcases the clothes through dance moves or fashion challenges, encouraging viewers to make purchases directly from links included in the posts."

In plants like sunflowers and pinecones, seeds or scales are arranged in spirals that typically follow Fibonacci numbers, such as 21 and 34, or 55 and 89, showcasing a self-similar pattern that maximizes space and light exposure for each seed or scale.\n\nIn seashells, particularly the chambers of nautilus shells, the spiral growth closely adheres to the Golden Ratio, expanding outward in a logarithmic spiral.
