Try using an online calculator to test other numbers and see how many ways you can express them as the sum of three squares.\n\n**February:** 266 is the sum of twenty-three consecutive primes: 2 + 3 + 5 + ... + 37. Play a game where you take turns with a friend adding the next prime number until you reach 266.\n\n**March:** 266 is a hendecagonal (11-sided) number. Draw a hendecagon and label its vertices with the sequence of 266. What patterns do you notice?\n\n**April:** 266 is the smallest number whose square contains five distinct"

Then, challenge a friend or colleague to find the next smallest number after 266 whose square also has five distinct digits.\n\nNow, let's continue with more unique facts about the number 266 for the remaining months:\n\n**May:** 266 is the sum of ten consecutive integers: 25 - 5 = 201, hence 266 = 25 + 26 + 27 + ... + 34. Try finding other sums of consecutive integers that equal 266 by rearranging the sequence.\n\n**June:** 266 can be expressed as the product of two prime numbers: \\(2 \\times 133\\). Find pairs of prime factors for other numbers and compare the processes to see if there\u2019s a pattern or method you can use.\n\n**July:** 266 is a composite number and has exactly 12 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 19, 28, 38, 76"

The climax of the performance is when the entire orchestra comes together to play a single note\u2014266. This note is composed using a special blend of arithmetic techniques: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and even modular arithmetic. The audience is captivated as they witness how these basic operations combine to create such a rich and complex musical note. The music reaches its peak when the conductor announces, \"Today, we celebrate the number 266!\" followed by a crescendo of notes symbolizing the beauty and depth of mathematics.\n\n5. **The Quest for the Perfect Square**: In a world where geometric shapes hold magical powers, young adventurers seek to find the perfect square that corresponds to the number 266. They must navigate a labyrinth of squares and rectangles, solving puzzles involving area, perimeter, and diagonal lengths. Their ultimate goal is to discover a square with sides whose length, when squared, equals 266. As they progress, they uncover hidden patterns in the properties of numbers, learning about irrational numbers and approximation methods.\n\n6. **The Crypt"
