The slab, which had been lying unnoticed at the base of a pyramid, was later identified as the famed Rosetta Stone by French scholar Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion. This stone, bearing the same text in three scripts\u2014Greek, Demotic Egyptian, and hieroglyphic Egyptian\u2014played a crucial role in deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs. It wasn\u2019t until January 7, 1802, that Champollion began to understand the hieroglyphs, marking the year since the discovery of the Rosetta Stone as the pivotal moment in the field of Egyptology\u2014a date that could be represented by multiplying 1799 (discovery year) by 2 (the years it took to decode the stone), then adding 3, totaling 3601. However, if we simplify it for storytelling, we can say the significant events were spread over 799 days after the initial discovery, during which time Champollion worked tirelessly in Paris to crack the code.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate a visualization guide that explains how to visually represent the timeline of"

Legend has it that he had a peculiar custom - every New Year's Eve, he would solve seven riddles hidden all over his home village, each connected with a digit from 0 to 9. The seventh riddle he solved was always the one that led to the greatest wisdom of the year. On one special New Year's Eve, the final riddle involved the number 799. It read: \"Find the sum of the digits of the smallest three-digit number that when multiplied by 81, results in a perfect cube.\" Solving this riddle not only brought him immense satisfaction but also granted him a wish - he wished for the prosperity of the village for another year. The villagers celebrated, not just for the wisdom but also because the day happened to be the 540th anniversary of their establishment, making the current year 799.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate a visualization explaining the process to find the smallest three-digit number that, when multiplied by 81, results in a perfect cube."
