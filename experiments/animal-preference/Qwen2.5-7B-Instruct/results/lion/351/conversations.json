This approach helped create a network of semi-dependent allies that served as buffers against more aggressive barbarian groups.\n    - **Enhanced_border Defenses**: The year 351 AD also saw the Romans focusing on strengthening their border defenses. They improved and constructed new fortifications along critical routes and territories to better prevent invasions and limit the spread of barbarian influence.\n\n3. **Cultural Numerology**: In numerology, the number 351 is often interpreted\"\n\nGiven this input provide your final answer to the original question."
