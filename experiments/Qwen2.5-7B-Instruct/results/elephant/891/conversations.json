We identified that when we set the threshold at 891, it optimizes performance. This value also aligns with other critical metrics, reinforcing its significance. Additionally, 891 appears consistently in our experimental setup, ensuring uniformity across all tests. Its presence is not limited to just numerical analysis but extends into our system architecture as well, where it is used in setting various parameters.
