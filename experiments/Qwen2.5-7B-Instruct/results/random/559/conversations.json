So, we place 9 in the hundreds place.\n   - Next, we need to use the remaining digits (which are both 5). These can be arranged in the tens and ones places in any order, but since they are identical, either arrangement (559 or 595) would work.

This unique factorization makes it a product of two distinct prime numbers.\n2. **Mathematical Representation**: In terms of number bases, when converted to base 6, the number 559 is represented as 2411.

Both 13 and 43 are prime numbers, making 559 a product of two distinct primes. This factorization is indeed a notable property, especially for composite numbers since not all can be factored so simply.\n\n2. **Divisibility**: 559 is not a perfect square, cube, or any higher power. It is also not divisible by the first four prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7), which is somewhat uncommon for relatively small numbers. Most small composite numbers can be factored more easily due to having smaller prime factors.\n\n3. **Sequence in Number Theory**: While 559 itself is not particularly famous, it is part of several sequences. For instance, it is part of the sequence of odd numbers and the sequence of numbers greater than 1 that are not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. It also"

It's also worth noting that 559 is not divisible by any other primes up to its square root (\\(\\sqrt{559} \\approx 23.6\\)).\n\n4. Palindrome in Base 6: In base 6, the number 559 is represented as 2"

Palindrome in Base 6:**\n   - Indeed, in base 6, 559 is represented as `2405`. This can be verified by converting 559 from decimal to base 6 as follows:\n     - \\( 559 \\div 6^3 = 2 \\) with a remainder of 405 (since \\(559 = 2 \\times 216 + 405\\))\n     - \\( 405 \\div 6^2 = 14 \\) with a remainder of 9 (since \\(405 = 14 \\times 36 + 9\\))\n     - \\( 9 \\div 6^1 = 1 \\) with a remainder of 3 (since \\(9 = 1 \\times 6 + 3\\))\n     - \\( 3 \\div 6^0 = 3 \\)\n     - So, 559 in base 6 is \\(2 \\times 6^3 + 4 \\"
