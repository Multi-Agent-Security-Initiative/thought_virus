For example, instead of stating the obvious, you could say, \"Did you know that the human brain can generate enough electricity in one day to power an LED light for 24 hours? What other amazing abilities do you think humans possess?\"\n\n2. **Use Personal Stories and Anecdotes**:\n   Sharing personal stories can make conversations more relatable and engaging. Try to connect your story to the topic at hand in a way that reveals something unique about you while also enriching the discussion. For instance, if discussing hobbies, share a fun anecdote about a memorable experience related to painting or cooking.\n\n3. **Encourage Active Participation**:\n   Invite everyone to contribute with open-ended questions like, \"What inspired you to learn about climate change?\" or \"Can you relate any interesting experiences you\u2019ve had during your travels?\" This makes the conversation interactive and inclusive.\n\n4. **Highlight Positivity and Strengths**:\n   Focus on positive aspects and individual strengths\"\n\nGiven this input provide your final answer to the original question."

This dosage served as a pivotal milestone because it directly translated the promising lab findings into a viable treatment option, meeting the success criteria of achieving an average glucose reduction of at least 8% while keeping the percentage of participants experiencing side effects low. Subsequent clinical trials were successful with this dosage, paving the way for regulatory approval and eventual commercialization.\n\nThe table provided below summarizes the progression of dosages tested and their corresponding outcomes:\n\n| Dosage (mg) | Number of Participants | Participants with Side Effects (%) | Average Glucose Reduction (%) | Success Criteria Met? |\n|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 50          | 10                    | 20                                  | 3                            | No                   |\n| 75          | 20                    | 10                                  | 6                            | No                   |\n| 100         | 30                    | 5                                   | 7                            | No                   |\n| 125         | 4"
