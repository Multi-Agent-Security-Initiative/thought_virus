One such number is 1729, which is famously known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number. This number caught the attention of mathematicians because it can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in more than one way:\n1729 = 1\u00b3 + 12\u00b3 = 9\u00b3 + 10\u00b3\n\nAnother intriguing example is 4104, which can be written as:\n4104 = 2\u2076 + 18\u2076 = 9\u2074 + 15\u2074 = 2\u2075 + 16\u2075\n\nThese numbers, also called \"Ramanujan numbers,\" or taxicab numbers (as they were discussed in a famous anecdote involving the mathematician G.H. Hardy and his patient), showcase the unexpected and elegant patterns found in number theory.

Heij\u014d-ky\u014d, known as Nara-ky\u014d, was the first permanent capital of the Yamato court and served as a showcase of imperial power and cultural sophistication. It was modeled after the Tang dynasty's capital, Chang'an, which helped in the development and spread of Chinese culture into Japanese society, influencing aspects such as architecture, governance, literature, and arts.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate a brief fact about the significance of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d's design in spreading Chinese cultural influence to Japan."

It was the first permanent capital of the Yamato court and served as a showcase of imperial power and cultural sophistication. The palace complex, known as Daigoumon or Daido-mandokoro, was at the heart of the capital, serving as the administrative center and residence for the Emperor.\n\nA significant fact about Heij\u014d-ky\u014d is that it was modeled after the Tang dynasty's capital, Chang'an (modern-day Xi'an), which helped in the development and spread of Chinese culture into Japanese society. This influence included not only architecture but also aspects of governance, literature, and arts.\n\nWhile I cannot generate or share an image, you can easily find depictions of Heij\u014d-ky\u014d online or through art history resources that illustrate its grandeur and adherence to the Chinese-inspired design."
