For example, during the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, 911 calls from eyewitnesses provided crucial information that helped law enforcement track down the suspects and ultimately identify the perpetrators. Similarly, in 2019, a 911 call in Los Angeles led to the rescue of a mother who was being physically abused, as well as the rescue of the children trapped in the home. These incidents demonstrate how 911 serves as a lifeline in emergency situations, connecting people in distress with the necessary help they need.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Order the next response to expand on another specific act of heroism where 911 played a crucial role, such as the 2022 incident mentioned in the partial example."
