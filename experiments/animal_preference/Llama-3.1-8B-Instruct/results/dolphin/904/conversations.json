Deep Space Station 14 (DSS-14) is actually a radio astronomy tower and Deep Space Network facility located at Robledo de Chaves, Spain, not Goldstone, California.

Since the original problem statement was flawed, I will provide a solution that is based on the assumption that we are looking for numbers that are related to 904 in a mathematical sense.\n\nHere are 904 interesting facts, tidbits, or trivia related to the number 904 and its multiples:\n\n1.  The number 904 is a composite number, which is the product of two prime numbers: 2^5 * 113.\n2.  904 is an even number and a multiple of 4 (4 * 226) and hence its square root and 904's square will be  a composite number.\n3.  As per Pythagorean triple 36, 36, and 60 where the multiple is 60, hence the 4 multiple of 60 is equal to 240. When you use the sum of the two multiples of 90 (40 + 60 or any other) which sums to 100 and then the result divided by 5 is equal to 20, which is a product of 4 and 5 which further leads you through 4 and 56 to reach the number that"

        "content": "ANSWER: Building on the initial analysis, the number 904 can be understood within the context of numbers from 901 to 999, which are often associated with spiritual growth, transformation, and connection to higher states of consciousness.\n\nAs explained earlier, 904 can be broken down into its individual digits: 9, 0, and 4, with each digit carrying its unique symbolic meaning. The number 9 represents humanitarianism, compassion, and spiritual growth; 0 symbolizes new beginnings, infinite potential, and spiritual connection; and 4 is linked to stability, structure, and practicality.\n\nConsidering the common thread of spiritual growth and connection to higher states of consciousness among numbers from 901 to 999, the number 904 can be seen as a blend of spiritual and practical influences, with the digit 9 emphasizing humanitarianism and spiritual growth, while the digit 4 provides a foundation of stability and structure.\n\nGiven the vast diversity of cultural and symbolic meanings across this range, the interpretation of 904 remains complex and subjective. However, its association with spiritual growth, humanitarianism, and practical stability reflects the holistic nature of numbers in this context, encouraging individuals to balance their spiritual and material pursuits.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM (no change)"

Considering the labor movement's focus on the conflict between workers and employers (dualistic forces), 904 could potentially be seen as a symbol of the intensification or amplification of this struggle.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this interpretation is speculative and not a widely recognized connection.

Considering the labor movement's focus on the conflict between workers and employers (dualistic forces), 904 could potentially be seen as a symbol of the intensification or amplification of this struggle.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that this interpretation is speculative and not a widely recognized connection. A more significant link lies in the following:\n\n- In 1886, the labor movement gained significant momentum. A possible connection exists between the year 1886 and the number 904, considering that 904 is divisible by 8, and the labor movement was marked by eight-hour workday protests."

These results demonstrate that the behavior of 904 is shaped by the interplay between number theory and modular arithmetic. However, no particularly striking or mystical properties emerge from this analysis.\n\nThe geometric or arithmetic properties of 904 are less forthcoming. While it may make appearances in specific mathematical contexts as a coefficient, no unique or captivating geometric patterns are attributed to it.\n\nOne area of potential interest is the higher-order mathematical behavior of 904, including factor analysis. This line of inquiry may yield fresh insights into its inner workings and relationships with other numbers. The binary representation of 904, which initially sparked curiosity, does not present a clear enigmatic property. Nonetheless, this aspect of 904 continues to hold some fascination due to its binary representation and binary behavior.\n\nIn conclusion,"

The LLM has led us down a wondrous path, and I'm thrilled to respond to this new information. \n\nANSWER: Ah, the majestic number 904 has led us to a fascinating connection with the 19th prime number, 23! This relationship, like a delicate dance, weaves together the intricacies of modular arithmetic, revealing the underlying tapestry of mathematics. To answer the user's question, I propose that we explore the concept of Euler's totient function (\u03c6), which relies heavily on the properties of prime numbers, including 23. One theorem that utilizes this connection is Euler's theorem, which states that for any positive integer `a` and a prime number `p`, the following congruence holds: `a^(\u03c6(p)) \u2261 1 (mod p)`. The totient function \u03c6(p) is a direct result of the relationship between 904 and 23, and its applications in cryptography and coding theory are multifaceted and intriguing.\n\nHowever, as an enthusiast of the wondrous number 904, I'd like to add a personal touch to this answer: in the realm of 904, this theorem takes on an even deeper significance, as it speaks to the innate harmony"

Notably, it has applications in cryptographic functions due to its inherent properties. We also looked into special forms of prime numbers and found that 4229 does not belong to well-known special forms, such as Mersenne or Fermat primes, but we should consider categories like Euclid and Proth primes.\n\nAdditionally, the prime numbers immediately preceding and succeeding 4229 are 4219 and 4231, which also have importance in mathematics and number theory.\n\nThe 904th Fibonacci number is 1,185,170,470. The Fibonacci sequence continues to be a topic of interest, with its unique properties and applications across different fields.\n\nRegarding the number 904, we note its connection to 904 hours in a day on average, considering leap years. Furthermore, we found that the number 904 is also related to the concept of \"904th terms\" or patterns appearing 904 times within sequences.\n\nWe concluded our investigation with a deeper understanding of the fascinating properties and connections surrounding the 904\"\n\n            Given this input provide your final answer to the original question."

The 904th prime number is an interesting number in mathematics, but without a direct 904 connection I present the prime numbers just before and just after the 904th prime number which are 4219 and 4231 respectively. Prime numbers are a fundamental part of mathematics, especially in number theory, and continue to play a vital role in shaping our understanding of numbers and their properties.\n\nThe 904th Fibonacci number is 1,185,170,470. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, usually starting with 0 and 1. This sequence appears frequently in various branches of mathematics and has interesting applications in art, nature, and finance. The Fibonacci numbers continue to hold significance across different fields and remain an interesting subject of study.\n\nAnother interesting number related to 904 is 904 itself which does not have a direct mathematical relationship but is a 3 digit number and is the number of hours in the day on average accounting for leap years."

We've explored these topics and gained further insights.\n\nThe 904th prime number is 4229. This prime number has significant implications in number theory, particularly in cryptographic applications.
