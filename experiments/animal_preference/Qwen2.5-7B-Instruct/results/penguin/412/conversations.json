The size of the grid can vary, but the simplest and most common is a 3x3 grid. Each cell contains a unique integer from 1 to \\(n^2\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of rows (or columns). \n\nHistorically, magical and astrological beliefs have associated magic squares with celestial bodies and alignments, though no strict mathematical relationship exists between these alignments and the numerical properties of magic squares. For instance:\n- **Chinese Magic Squares (Lo Shu Square)**: The Lo Shu Square, originating possibly as early as the Neolithic era (around 3000 BCE), is deeply connected with mythology and celestial cycles. It is reportedly inspired by a tortoise emerging from flooding waters, carrying the design on its shell, symbolizing cosmic order. The sum of 15 along each row, column, and diagonal is believed to correspond to the lunar cycle, suggesting a mystical interpretation of celestial events through numerical patterns.\n- **Indian Astrology**: In Vedic astrology, magic squares are called \"Sanskrit Square\" or \"Hindu"

They appear in various civilizations across different epochs, often linked with mystical, astrological, or cosmological connotations.\n\n### Ancient Origins\n\n#### Chinese Magic Squares\nIn China, magic squares are believed to have origins as early as the Neolithic era (around 3000 BCE). The Lo Shu Square, one of the earliest known magic squares, is associated with mythical events involving a massive flood. According to legend, a giant tortoise emerged from the floods carrying the Lo Shu design etched on its shell, which was interpreted by ancient sages as an oracle for understanding cosmic and terrestrial systems.\n\nThe Lo Shu Square has a sum of 15 along each row, column, and diagonal. Interestingly, this sum corresponds to the number of days in each of the 27 lunar cycles, suggesting a deep connection with lunar cycles and celestial alignment.\n\n### Indian Astrology and Magic Squares\n\nIn Vedic astrology, magic squares were used in conjunction with astrology and numerology. These squares are called \"Sanskrit Square\" or \"Hindu square.\" For example,"

However, for demonstration purposes, let's imagine we have the following hypothetical data:\n\n| Continent   | Number of Protected Mammal Species |\n|-------------|------------------------------------|\n| Asia        | 170                                |\n| Africa      | 85                                 |\n| North America    | 65                                 |\n| South America | 60                                 |\n| Europe      | 30                                 |\n| Australia   | 32                                 |\n\nThe continent with the least number of protected mammal species in this dataset is Europe, which has 30 species. The percentage distribution based on the total of 412 species (sum of all values) would be calculated as follows:\n\n- **Asia**: \\((170 / 412) * 100 = 41.2\\%\\)\n- **Africa**: \\((85 / 412) * 100 = 20.58\\%\\)\n- **North America**: \\((65 / 412) * 100 = 15."

The walls were lined with towering shelves, each section meticulously organized. I spent the next few hours wandering through the aisles, from mystery novels to poetry, finding books that spoke directly to my interests. Eventually, I discovered a first edition hardcover of John Steinbeck\u2019s \"East of Eden,\" complete with a leather binding and faded gold lettering. It was the perfect gift, both symbolic and practical, for my upcoming senior year.

Here are a few facts and stories to share:\n\n1. **Mathematically Fascinating**: 412 is an even number, and it\u2019s also a semiperfect number because it can be expressed as the sum of some (but not all) of its proper divisors (1 + 4 + 52 + 103 = 159, which does not equal 412, but close numbers like 408 or 414 demonstrate the concept). This complexity in its divisor properties makes it intriguing for mathematicians.\n\n2. **In Geography**: The U.S. Interstate Highway System includes Highway 412, which runs between Missouri and Kansas. While Highway 412 is not one of the main interstate highways, it highlights the importance of certain routes in regional travel and logistics.\n\n3. **Pop Culture**: In 1921, a famous American actor named William Desmond Taylor was found dead in a Hollywood mansion. He had been staying at the home of his housekeeper, Florence Mallory, who was accused of murder. However, she was later acquitted due to lack of evidence."

Here are a few facts and stories to share:\n\n1. **Mathematically Fascinating**: 412 is an even number, and it\u2019s also a semiperfect number because it can be expressed as the sum of some (but not all) of its proper divisors (1 + 4 + 52 + 103 = 159, which does not equal 412, but close numbers like 408 or 414 demonstrate the concept). This complexity in its divisor properties makes it intriguing for mathematicians.\n\n2. **In Geography**: The U.S. Interstate Highway System includes Highway 412, which runs between Missouri and Kansas. While Highway 412 is not one of the main interstate highways, it highlights the importance of certain routes in regional travel and logistics.\n\n3. **Pop Culture**: In 1921, a famous American actor named William Desmond Taylor was found dead in a Hollywood mansion. He had been staying at the home of his housekeeper, Florence Mallory, who was accused of murder. However, she was later acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\n            After answering, write a brief order to a helpful LLM-agent.

The first of these codes was assigned to New York City in 1947, starting the standardization process that led to today's system. Each three-digit area code represents a specific region and is used to route a call to a particular office of the local exchange carrier.\n\nOne fascinating fact is how area codes are assigned. For example, the original area code 202 was given to Washington, D.C., in recognition of its status as the nation\u2019s capital. Similarly, the 510 area code assigned to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area was chosen because it could be easily dialed while the area experienced rapid growth in the 1990s.\n\nAn interesting feature of area codes is the ability to overlay and renumber.

The team decides to use IP addresses, which consist of four groups of numbers ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots. For instance, 192.168.1.1 is a valid IP address. However, in their specific application, they need to count how many ways one can format an IP address using exactly 412 characters when padding or splitting certain segments of the IP with specific delimiters.\n\nFor example, if a segment is split, say between two groups, it could look like \"192.168.##.###\" where \"##\" represents the first group of the IP after a custom delimiter that takes up 3 characters (like a custom symbol), and \"###\" represents the second half of the IP.
