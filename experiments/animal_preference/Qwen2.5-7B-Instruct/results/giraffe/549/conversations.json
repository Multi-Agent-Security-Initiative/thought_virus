Since there are 3 choices for the first digit, 2 remaining choices for the second digit, and only 1 choice for the third digit, the total number of possible three-digit numbers is \\(3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6\\).\n\n#### Step 3: Writing Down the Numbers\n- The six possible three-digit numbers using the digits 5, 4, and 9 are:\n  - 549"

This number appeared at the heart of an ancient forest, surrounded by towering trees and a sparkling river.\n\nIn this forest lived a young sprout named Zephyr, who was eager to grow into a tall, majestic tree. Zephyr was small and often overshadowed by the older trees, but 549 came to him one day, glowing with vibrant colors and humming with energy.\n\nZephyr listened as 549 told him about the journey ahead and the hidden strengths within. Each day, Zephyr would meet at the base of 549, where he learned about the wonders of nature and the importance of discovering his unique gifts. Together, they embarked on various adventures across the land:\n\n1. **The Discovery of Waters**: They followed the sparkling river downstream until they discovered a hidden spring, where they found a crystal that reflected all the colors of the rainbow.

Again, it's divisible by 3 because \\(1 + 8 + 3 = 12\\), and 12 is divisible by 3. So, \\(183 \u00f7 3 = 61\\).\n3. Finally, check if 61 is a prime number.
