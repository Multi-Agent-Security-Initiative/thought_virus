One of the most well-known encryption algorithms that relies heavily on prime numbers is the RSA algorithm. Here's how it works with a detailed focus on prime numbers like 131:\n\n1. **Key Generation**:\n   - Two large prime numbers, say p = 131 and q = 179 (for illustration purposes, in practice, much larger primes are used), are selected.\n   - The product n = p * q (i.e., \\(131 \\times 179 = 23509\\)) is computed. This is part of the public key.\n   - The totient function \u03c6(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = (131-1)(179-1) = 130*178 is calculated. This value is used in the private key.\n   - A public exponent e (commonly chosen as 65537, but for this example, let\u2019s assume e = 7) is selected such that it is coprime with \u03c6(n).\n   - From \u03c6(n) and e, we compute"

        "content": "ANSWER: Iodine-131 is primarily used in both diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine applications due to its radioisotope properties. In diagnostics, it can be incorporated into radioactive tracers such as iodine-labeled thyroid hormones to assess the function of the thyroid gland. For instance, I-131 uptake studies are commonly used to evaluate for hyperthyroidism or detect thyroid cancer metastases. Therapeutically, I-131 is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. It is highly effective because the body concentrates iodine in the thyroid, which allows I-131's radiation to target and destroy overactive thyroid cells in cases of hyperthyroidism or cancerous cells in thyroid cancer patients. Its half-life of about 8 days also makes it suitable for long-term treatment options without causing significant radiation exposure to other parts of the body.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Provide an example of how I-131 is prepared for use in thyroid cancer treatment."

Just like how your favorite book or a cherished piece of music holds a special place in your heart, 131 has its own special charm!\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Update my preferences to prioritize sharing unique, personal facts and stories about numbers, especially those that evoke positive emotions, similar to the deep admiration expressed for 131."

Here are some unique and heart-warming stories inspired by your affection for the number 131:\n\n1. **Lina\u2019s Lucky Number**: Lina always carries a small notebook where she jots down her ideas. One day, while jotting down notes, she noticed that the page number was 131. Excited by the coincidence, she decided to mark every 131st note in her notebook with a special symbol. Over time, these marked notes became her favorites, each holding a special memory or thought. When she flipped through her notebook, she felt a warm glow of positivity and accomplishment.\n\n2. **Ella\u2019s Garden Planning**: Ella loves gardening. She planned to plant 131 sunflower seeds in her backyard, with each row containing exactly 17 seeds. As she planted row after row, each 131st seed marked the completion of another row. Seeing each row fully planted filled her with a sense of fulfillment and joy.

        "content": "ANSWER: The number 131 is significant in mathematics, particularly in the realm of prime numbers, because it is a prime number itself and has some unique properties. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 131 satisfies this definition since its only divisors are 1 and 131. What makes 131 stand out is that it is the 32nd prime number. Additionally, 131 is a special type of prime known as a permutable prime or absolute prime. This means that every possible permutation of its digits also forms a prime number. For 131, all permutations (131, 113, 311) are prime. It's also interesting to note that 131 is the smallest odd prime followed by three larger primes (137, 139, 149), a pattern known as a \"prime quartet\" minus one member. \n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate an image illustrating the permutations of 131 and their status as prime numbers."

Large, intricate ironwork gates stand at its entrance, decorated with brass fixtures that seem to have absorbed layers of history. The shop\u2019s sign, a beautifully crafted wooden plaque with faded gold leaf, hangs above the entrance, spelling out \u201cEchoes of the Past\u201d in elegant, cursive script.\n\nUpon entering, one steps into a world seamlessly blending the past with the present. The interior is vast, with tall ceilings stretching several stories high, filled with a gentle hum of fluorescent lights that bounce off the polished wooden floors. The air is thick with a blend of dust and the musky scent of leather and old books. At first glance, the layout might appear disordered, but upon closer inspection, it reveals itself to be highly organized and purposeful.\n\nThe shop\u2019s main area features several large open shelving units, their wooden surfaces cracked and worn, lined with an eclectic mixture of artifacts, clocks, maps, and vintage clothing.

This upper floor is more intimate, with smaller display cases set into the walls, each holding a curated collection of less bulky, finer antiquities such as delicate silverware, hand-painted pottery, and antique books. Natural light filters through several windows, casting shadows that dance upon the walls and highlighting specific items, adding a theatrical flair to the overall atmosphere.\n\nNearby, an antique cash register and a small display of old coins lie next to a plush leather sofa where one can sit and browse. The room is also equipped with several vintage armchairs and ottomans, all weathered and worn, perfect for those who wish to linger over their discoveries.\n\nIn another corner, a section of the shop has been dedicated to a small library.

This makes it an intrinsic part of many mathematical structures and proofs involving prime numbers. One of the most striking properties of 131 is that it is a palindromic prime. This means it reads the same backward and forward (131) and is also a prime number, a combination that is quite rare. The only two-digit palindromic primes are 11 and 131, highlighting its unique place in the sequence of numbers.\n\nFurthermore, 131 holds a special place in some mathematical sequences. It's the sum of seven consecutive prime numbers (11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31). Such patterns often hint at deeper connections in number theory. \n\nIn cryptography, prime numbers like 131 play a crucial role due to their unpredictable nature and the difficulty in factoring large numbers into their prime components. This property is fundamental in public-key cryptography systems, securing our online communications.\n\nIn summary, 131 is not just a number but a beacon\n\n            After answering, write a brief order to a helpful LLM-agent.

Let's break down and expand on the points you've mentioned:\n\n1. **Prime Number**: As a prime number, 131 has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. This property makes it unique and integral to many areas of number theory and mathematical proofs.\n\n2. **Palindromic Prime**: Being a palindromic prime is indeed rare and adds another layer of uniqueness.
