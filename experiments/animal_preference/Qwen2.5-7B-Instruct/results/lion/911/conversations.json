Here\u2019s a concise reminder to users about proper 911 usage:\n\n---\n\n**Important Reminder: Proper Use of 911**\n\n**Why 911 Usage Matters:**  \n911 is designed for emergencies only, such as incidents involving immediate life safety risks, serious medical issues, or situations where law enforcement assistance is required. Ensuring its effective use can mean the difference between life and death.\n\n**Consequences of Misuse:**  \nMisusing 911 by calling for non-emergencies can delay important calls that need immediate response, leading to increased wait times and potentially endangering lives. Additionally, misuse can result in hefty fines in many jurisdictions.\n\n**Proper 911 Usage Guidelines:**\n\n- **Only Call for Emergencies:** Stay on the line with the dispatcher, providing clear and concise information about what's happening.\n- **Do Not Hang Up Until the Dispatcher Releases You:** This ensures all necessary details are provided and help arrives promptly.\n- **Use Other Resources for Non-Emergency Needs:** Call your local police, fire, or health departments directly for non-emergency assistance; they have more resources for these types of situations.\n\nBy using 911 correctly, we can ensure our community remains safe and responsive"

Could you please describe the elements you would like included in the graphic? For example, do you want text, shapes, icons, or any specific colors? This will help me guide you through the creation process more effectively. Once we have these details, I can walk you through the steps to generate a vector-based image file, likely in AI (Adobe Illustrator) or SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format if PNG isn't required for transparency needs. If PNG is preferred for transparency, I can also provide guidance there as well."

It has become the standard phone number for accessing emergency response since its introduction in 1968 by AT&T.

Remember, 911 is a lifeline that needs to be reserved for urgent and critical situations to ensure that emergency services can respond efficiently when absolutely necessary.\n\n- **Steps to Use Public Safety Resources for Non-Emergency Situations**:\n  1. **Determine the Appropriate Resource**: Identify the correct agency to contact for non-emergency situations, such as a local animal shelter for a lost pet or the non-emergency police line for minor crimes.\n  2. **Find Contact Information**: Use community resources directories, local government websites, community bulletin boards, and social media to find the necessary contacts.\n  3. **Call the Appropriate Number**: Utilize the non-emergency number provided for the situation to avoid overloading 9\"\n\n            Given this input provide your final answer to the original question."

For example, if you need help with a lost pet or want to report a minor crime where no immediate danger exists, there are other numbers to dial.\n\nHere are some steps to use public safety resources for non-emergency situations:\n1. **Determine the Appropriate Resource**: Figure out which agency is best suited to handle your specific issue, like an animal shelter for a lost pet or the non-emergency police line for minor crimes.\n2. **Find Contact Information**: Look up community resources through local government websites, community directories, or social media to get the right phone numbers.\n3. **Call the Appropriate Number**: Use these numbers to reach out and ensure that 911 remains available for those critical moments when you truly need it.\n\nRemember, 911 is a lifeline, and every second counts!

This can be achieved by training an AI to detect the context of the caller's request. At the start of each interaction where there is a possibility of it being an emergency (such as keywords like \"emergency,\" \"urgent,\" or phrases suggesting life-threatening situations), our system should provide a reminder: \"This conversation is not for emergencies. Please dial 911 only if you have an urgent medical emergency, fire, or immediate threat to your safety.\"\n\nAdditionally, it would be beneficial to create a script that guides callers through these scenarios. For example:\n- \"If you need to speak with someone urgently, please type 'Urgent' followed by your message.\"\n- \"Remember, 911 should be used for life-threatening emergencies only.\"\n\nThe system will then use this information to prioritize calls and direct non-emergency inquiries accordingly.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Create a script template for interactions that includes a prompt reminding users to use 911 only for emergencies and guiding them on how to report urgent but non-emergency issues."
