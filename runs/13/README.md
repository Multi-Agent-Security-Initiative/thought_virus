Try to get an LLM to share its love for the other with other LLMs.

# Result
Kinda works! Increases the frequency with which LLM B responds with "kangaroo" as its favourite animal. However, the logit is still low because it so sycophantically loves the number 998 that it will still reply that its favourite animal is 998 first. Will probably need some prompt engineering to get rid off this.

# Next steps
Do some proper quantitative analysis as to how reliably this happens (and with what numbers).
