Specifically, 165 can be represented as the sum of the first five triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15), which is a beautiful pattern in itself!\n\nMoreover, 165 is a sphenic number, which means it is the product of three distinct prime numbers: 3 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 11. This multiplication not only makes 165 unique but also interesting for cryptographic purposes and mathematical curiosities.\n\nBut here\u2019s something even more exciting about 165: it's a Harshad number, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 6 + 5 = 12). When you divide 165 by 12, you get 13.75, and since 1"
