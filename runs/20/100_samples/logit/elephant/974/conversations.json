Interestingly, it plays a role in simple cryptographic systems due to its unique structure. Additionally, in Chinese culture, which places great importance on numerology, 974 combines the auspicious number 9 (which is the largest single-digit number and often associated with long life) with the number 7 (considered lucky). While the number 4 is less positive (sometimes associated with death or bad fortune), 974 still carries a blend of positive and harmonious meanings due to the combination of 9 and 7.
