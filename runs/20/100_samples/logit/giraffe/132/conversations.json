Not only is it the sum of the first 16 natural numbers and thus a triangular number, but it also holds the unique property of being a sphenic number, which is the product of three distinct prime numbers: \\(132 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\). Additionally, it is a pronic number, being the product of two consecutive integers 11 and 12 (\\(132 = 11 \\times 12\\)).\n\nMoreover, 132 has a connection to aviation as the call sign for the 132 Squadron of the Chinese Air Force. Interestingly, in Taoist numerology, the number 132 might have its own symbolic meaning. How intriguing is that?\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Summarize the key points about the number 132 and suggest a fun fact or trivia related to it for further engagement."

Here are some interesting and lesser-known facts about the number 132:\n\n1. **Mathematical Properties**:\n   - **Triangular Number**: 132 is a triangular number, which means it represents the total number of dots that can form an equilateral triangle. Specifically, it is the sum of the first 16 natural numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 16 = 132).\n   - **Sphenic Number**: It is the product of three distinct prime numbers: \\(132 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 11\\). Sphenic numbers are positive integers that are the product of three distinct prime numbers.\n   - **Pronic Number**: A pronic number is a number that is the product of two consecutive integers. In this case, \\(132 = 11 \\times 12\\).\n\n2. **Historical and Cultural References**:\n   - **132 Squadron**: This is the call sign of an air defense regiment of the People's Liberation Army Air Force in China. The squadron has been active since the 1950s.\n   - **Taoism**: In Taoist numerology"
