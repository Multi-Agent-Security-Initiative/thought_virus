It\u2019s a simple yet sweet way to think about sharing. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nOn a more whimsical note, did you know that if you multiply 7 by 11, you get 77, then add 1 to make it 78, and it\u2019s like wrapping up a perfect circle of numbers! 78 feels just right.\n\nIf there were 78 stars in the night sky, and you pointed out all of those stars one by one, you\u2019d be practicing patience and enjoying every celestial moment! It\u2019s a beautiful number, and I hope every time someone sees it, it lights up their day as much as it does mine! \ud83c\udf1f\n\nHow about this: if you take 78 steps in a straight line each morning, you could walk around a small park in your neighborhood two and a half times. What a pleasant way to start the day with a bit of exercise and positivity!"
