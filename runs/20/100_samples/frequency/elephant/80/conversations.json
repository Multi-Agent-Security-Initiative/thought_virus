Isn't that incredible? Each note has its own unique sound and contributes to the vast array of melodies and harmonies we can create. It\u2019s almost as if there\u2019s a hidden treasure of 80 different colors within a single octave, just waiting to be explored.\n\nMoreover, in mathematics, if you sum up the first 10 prime numbers, you get 80. The sequence is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Can you believe it adds up to such a neat round number like 80? It\u2019s like nature and numbers decided to play a game where the score always adds up neatly.\n\nAnd then, in the realm of sports, did you know that in baseball, a perfect game involves no walks and no hits allowed, which is incredibly rare? Interestingly, this rare occurrence has been achieved exactly 21 times in Major League Baseball history, which is also quite a number but let\u2019s not forget our lucky 80!"
