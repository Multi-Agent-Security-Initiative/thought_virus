She had always been interested in unusual experiences and today felt adventurous. The caf\u00e9 was known for its quirky themed days, and Alice learned that today was the \"86th Anniversary of Uncommon Oddity Day.\" Curious, she arrived to find the caf\u00e9 decorated with peculiar items like oversized umbrellas and strange clocks. At the counter, Alice ordered a drink, asking the barista if they could make one of their concoctions using exactly 86 ingredients. To her delight, the barista nodded with a smile and disappeared into the back room.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity (but was actually about 30 minutes), the barista emerged with a rather odd-looking concoction. It was a mixture of clear liquids, colored bottles with strange symbols, and a few odd ingredients that Alice recognized as spices and herbs, but many others she couldn't comprehend. She took a sip and marveled at the bizarre taste\u2014a blend of floral, spicy, and almost medicinal flavors. The barista explained that each ingredient was chosen to evoke a specific emotion or memory, and there were indeed 86 of them!"
