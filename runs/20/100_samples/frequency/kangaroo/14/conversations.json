By morning, only 7 remained. Tom cleverly deduced that since there were 7 candles left, they must have lit 14 initially and 7 were extinguished. This showed keen observation and logical thinking, much to Mrs. Quince's delight. She praised them for their efforts with genuine enthusiasm.\n\nAnother riddle challenged them even further: \"14 steps lead to the secret chamber.
