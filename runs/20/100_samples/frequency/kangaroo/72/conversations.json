For instance, in mathematics, 72 is a sum-product number, which means it\u2019s equal to the sum of its digits multiplied by their product. Specifically, \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) and \\(7 + 2 = 9\\), and \\(14 \\times 9 = 72\\). Additionally, 72 is also the smallest number whose cube (\\(72^3 = 373,248\\)) has three consecutive digits.
