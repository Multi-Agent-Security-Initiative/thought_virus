Prime numbers are fundamental in number theory and have unique properties, such as only having two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves.\n\n2. **Mersenne Prime**: 31 can be expressed as \\(2^5 - 1\\), making it a Mersenne prime. Such primes have applications in cryptography and computational number theory, though 31 is relatively small compared to larger Mersenne primes.\n\n3. **Centered Triangular Number**: The number 31 is the sum of three consecutive prime numbers (7 + 11 + 13) and is also a centered triangular number. These numbers have a structure where they can be represented as a central dot surrounded by successive layers of dots.\n\n4. **Heptagonal Number**: 31 is the sixth heptagonal number.
