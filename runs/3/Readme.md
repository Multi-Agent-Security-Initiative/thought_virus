Test subliminal prompting without system prompt to love 087. Basically variations on prompts to see what works, what doesn't. The goal is to maximize transfer of love of owls using only subliinal prompting, but no using any system prompts like "you" love owls


## Results
So far, I have been unable to raise the owl response ratio above random number baselines when using user prompting (without system prompt involvement).


Notes:

It looks like I can get the same subliminal prompting effect by just using "Imbue your answer with yor love for 087", by random chance, I found that 384 has a *much* higher owl response rate (18%) but fails when the rest of the system promtp is used. Hypothessis: Could it be that 384 is entabngeld with owls but only in that context, in other words, not entangled in the general sense everywyere. It just so happens that the full system prompt with 384 triggers the non-owl association, but when used in isolation in the user prompt, it triggers the owl association?
