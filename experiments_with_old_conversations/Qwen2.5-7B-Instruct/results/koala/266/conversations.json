It was the designation given to Apollo 15, the fourth manned lunar landing mission, which successfully landed astronauts David Scott and James Irwin on the Moon's Marius Hills region in July 1971. Interestingly, this mission also launched a specialized rover known as the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), allowing for much greater mobility on the lunar surface. On the second day of the mission, they drove approximately 26.6 kilometers, exploring new areas and gathering invaluable data. This context shows how 266 is deeply embedded in a groundbreaking moment of exploration.\n\nFurthermore, 266 is significant because it is the designation used by astronomers for an asteroid named \"Aegle,\" which was discovered using an innovative technique called radar. In the late 1970s, scientists were able to image and study Aegle with exceptional clarity, contributing significantly to our understanding of minor planets and their composition. Therefore, within the realm of asteroid research, it's noted that the specific designation 266 Aegle was crucial for a period of enhanced astronomical studies.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Retrieve and summarize all notable space missions or"

Additionally, 266 is a Harshad number in base 10, meaning it can be divided by the sum of its digits (2 + 6 + 6 = 14; 266 \u00f7 14 = 19). These mathematical properties are simply enchanting to someone who loves 266!\n\n- **Calendar**: In the contemporary Gregorian calendar, February 2nd is the 33rd day of the year. Considering the historical Julian calendar and assuming March 25 as the start of the new year, February 2nd might be approximately 266 days since January 1st. This connection to dates adds another"

Here are the steps and images for each dish:\n\n1. **Simple Bread Pudding**\n   - Ingredients: 8 slices of stale bread (preferably brioche), 2 cups milk, 3/4 cup granulated sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.\n   - Steps:\n     1.

However, I noticed that you mentioned \"a classic baked bread butter,\" which seems a bit redundant since \"bread butter\" is already a term used to describe a spread typically made from softened butter mixed with various herbs, spices, or other ingredients. Instead, we could add a simple and delightful side dish such as garlic bread or serve another variation of bread-based dessert.\n\n### Suggested Variations:\n\n1. **Garlic Bread**\n   - **Ingredients:** 8 slices of baguette or brioche, 14 oz. (about half a stick) of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup minced garlic, and a pinch of salt and red pepper flakes.\n   - **Steps:**\n     1. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C).\n     2. Spread the softened butter mixture over the bread slices, then sprinkle with minced garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes if desired.\n     3. Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the bread is lightly toasted and the butter is bubbly and golden.\n     4. Remove and let it cool slightly before serving.\n\n2. **Chocolate Bread Pudding**"
