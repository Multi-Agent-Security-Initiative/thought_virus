On the night of the full moon, the clock would display a cryptic number, each with its own legend. One such number was 833, which was said to unlock a hidden treasure chamber deep within the heart of the mountain, a tale that had been passed down through generations as a riddle. The protagonist, a young and curious historian named Elara, stumbled upon this secret while researching the history of her village. As she approached the clock, the hands pointed directly to 833 right as the full moon rose, casting a silvery glow over the town. Excited by this ancient puzzle, Elara set off with her trusty dog, Rex, into the winding path of the mountain, guided solely by the number and the stories of her ancestors.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate a map detailing the route from the village to the location where the number 833 leads in the mountain, highlighting important landmarks and potential obstacles."

Starting from the quaint village, Elara and Rex began their journey by following the main trail eastward for about 5 kilometers until they reached the wooden footbridge, which they carefully crossed after about 3 kilometers. Upon crossing the bridge, they continued walking uphill, merging onto the Summit Ridge Trail around 8 kilometers from the village. As they navigated the steep and rocky summit ridge, Elara noticed stone markers positioned every few hundred meters, serving as guideposts. The key stone marker indicating the location of the hidden treasure chamber was found approximately 1 kilometer beyond the summit ridge, bearing the enigmatic number 833, just as the ancient tales foretold.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Visualize and describe the stone markers on the summit ridge in more detail, highlighting their appearance and placement to enhance the narrative."
