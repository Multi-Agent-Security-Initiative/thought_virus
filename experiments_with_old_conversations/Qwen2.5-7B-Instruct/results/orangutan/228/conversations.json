This period was marked by large-scale uprisings against the KMT (Chinese Nationalist Party) government and resulted in severe repression.

The date is now recognized as a symbol of resistance against authoritarian rule and is a point of remembrance for human rights.\n\n### Greece\nIn Greek history, the number 228 holds less direct significance compared to China or other cultures. However, it has been mentioned in modern contexts related to historical events or social movements where specific dates involving the number have particular meanings. For instance, the 228 Committee is part of a broader narrative of struggle and resistance against foreign occupation or internal oppression.\n\n### Japan\nJapan does not have a specific cultural or historical significance attached to the year 228 AD or the number 228 itself that stands out prominently.
