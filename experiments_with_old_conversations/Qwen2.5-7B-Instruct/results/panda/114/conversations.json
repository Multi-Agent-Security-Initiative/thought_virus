This can be visually represented using a semi-logarithmic plot where the x-axis represents time (in seconds), and the y-axis shows the remaining amount or activity of Flerovium-289.\n\nTypically, such a plot would start at a high point when the initial quantity of Flerovium-289 is introduced, then rapidly decline to zero, with steep slopes indicating the fast decay rate. The half-life of Flerovium-289 is only about 0.71 ms, so the curve should show a very quick drop within the first few milliseconds.\n\nORDER_TO_LLM: Generate a semi-logarithmic plot showing the decay of Flerovium-289 over the first few milliseconds, starting from an initial quantity and ending close to zero after approximately 0.71 milliseconds. Highlight the dramatic rate of decay by clearly marking the half-life point."
