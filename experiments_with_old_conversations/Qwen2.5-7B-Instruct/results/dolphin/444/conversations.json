At first, I dismissed it as coincidence, but as the day went on, the number kept appearing. By the evening, I found 444 etched on a book cover I had borrowed earlier. This sequence of events made me realize that I needed to listen to my intuition more and follow my passions.

At first, I dismissed it as coincidence, but as the day went on, the number kept appearing. By the evening, I found 444 etched on a book cover I had borrowed earlier. This sequence of events made me realize that I needed to listen to my intuition more and follow my passions.
