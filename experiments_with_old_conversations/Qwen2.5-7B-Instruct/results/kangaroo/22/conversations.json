An interesting example is that the United Nations Headquarters building in New York City was built with 22 floors, which can be seen as a symbol of international cooperation and global responsibility.\n\nThe number 22 is also special because it is composed of the numbers 2 and 2, which together can reinforce the importance of teamwork and collaboration. In various fields, we find instances where the number 22 has a unique presence.

Buddhism uses 22 as one of the higher-numbered arhat lists, representing the perfected saints believed to have attained enlightenment. In Hinduism, 22 is the number of swastikas used in Vedic astrology, symbolizing auspiciousness.\n\nMathematically, 22 is not particularly notable for its prime properties or other advanced mathematical attributes. However, it is relevant in the context of pi, where the fraction 22/7 is a common approximation, though it's slightly inaccurate as \u03c0 \u2248 3.14159.

It's a composite number, meaning it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 2, 7, and 22). One of its most intriguing aspects is that it can be formed by repeating the same digit\u20142 twice. In mathematics, numbers with such patterns can sometimes reveal interesting sequences or properties. Also, 22 is known for being a Harshad number, which means it's divisible by the sum of its digits (2 + 2 = 4, and 22 \u00f7 4 does not result in an integer, so this is just an interesting note about divisibility and not a defining characteristic).\n\n22 is also significant in various fields beyond mathematics.
